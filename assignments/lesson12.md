## Problem 2
Devise an algorithm for the following problem. Then give the asymptotic running time of your algorithm, including an explanation of how you arrived at this running time.
Algorithm: IsReachableFrom(G, u, v)
Input: A directed graph G, vertices u, v in G
Output: TRUE if there is a directed path from u to v in G, false otherwise.
