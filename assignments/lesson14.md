## Problem 5
Use dynamic programming, `B[i, j]` denotes whether there is a subset with previous i integers in the set whose sum is j. We can build such an array from `B[0, 1]` to `B[n, 10]`, then iterate over the `B[0, 10]` to `B[n, 10]` and return the `i` with the first `i` that makes `B[i][10]` to be true.
